This a educational website for a school task. I was tasked with making a portfolio about myself and to show what I learned about HTML, CSS and Javascript.

I used FontAwesome for the icons at the end of the website.

I used tutorials on the internet for my javascript, because I'm fairly new to it and I don't have the ability to code what I want to have on the site.

I'm going to continue working with my portfolio and possibly add other websites linked to it for example a game that I'm working on.
